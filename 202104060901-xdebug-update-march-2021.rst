Another monthly update where I explain what happened with Xdebug development
in this past month. These will be published on the first Tuesday after the 5th
of each month.

`Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ and `GitHub
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr/>`_ supporters will get it earlier,
around the first of each month.

You can `become a patron <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328>`_ or
support me through `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_.
I am currently 91% towards my $1,000 per month goal.
If you are leading a team or company, then it is also possible to support
Xdebug through `a subscription <https://xdebug.org/support>`_.

In March, I worked on Xdebug for about 28 hours, with funding being
around 32 hours.

Xdebug 3.1
----------

I started working on the Xdebug 3.1 `tasks
<https://bugs.xdebug.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=87>`_, and so far I have
mostly been working on making sure that Xdebug continues to compile with PHP
8, and on improvements to `xdebug_info()
<https://xdebug.org/docs/all_functions#xdebug_info>`_. It now also includes
whether a debug connection was successful, which IP address it connected to,
and whether some protocol features are enabled.

I have also started triaging really old bug reports, and will close them if no
extra information is provided. This should cut down on my "open issues" queue.


Xdebug Videos
-------------

As response to a few people mentioning on Twitter that "Xdebug is hard to set
up with Docker", and in line with my original goals of creating content to
show how to set up Xdebug within various set-ups, I have created a few videos.

I have released the first one, `Xdebug with Docker and PhpStorm in 5 Minutes
<https://youtu.be/vG0bioOSlys>`_ on YouTube, where you can also find other
Xdebug videos in the `Xdebug 3 play list <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4>`_.


Xdebug Cloud
------------

`Xdebug Cloud <https://xdebug.cloud>`_ is continuing to operate as Beta
release, and provides an easy way to debug your PHP applications with Xdebug,
without having to deal with complexities with regards to networking.

Packages start at Â£49/month, and revenue will also be used to further the
development of Xdebug.

If you want to be kept up to date with Xdebug Cloud, please sign up to the
`mailinglist <https://xdebug.cloud/newsletter>`_, which I will use to send out
an update not more than once a month.


Business Supporter Scheme and Funding
-------------------------------------

In March, no new supporters signed up.

If you, or your company, would also like to support Xdebug, head over to the
`support <https://xdebug.org/support>`_ page!

Besides business support, I also maintain a `Patreon
<https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ page and a profile on `GitHub sponsors
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_.
