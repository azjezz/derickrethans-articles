In the last few years I have walked a lot. Longer distance paths such as the
`Thames Path <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Path>`_, the `LOOP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Outer_Orbital_Path>`_, and the `North
Downs Way
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/derickrethans/albums/72157709293692196>`_.
During 2021 I walked the length of the Grand Union Canal, and in the last few
months I did one-day hikes on routes in London, with the intention to pick
longer walks again in summer, such as the `South Downs Way
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Downs_Way>`_, and `The Ridgeway
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ridgeway>`_. I use the `Waymarked Trails
<https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#route?id=13678910&type=relation&map=12.0/51.4767/0.3905>`_
website to find the smaller routes, which uses data based on `OpenStreetMap
<https://openstreetmap.org>`_. I have been contributing mapping data to
OpenStreetMap for more than a decade now, and find it generally the best
mapping data in the UK, especially in the country side.

When I was planning my second walk of this year at the beginning of January, I
read on Twitter that a `new section
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/12/a-peculiar-beauty-strolling-on-a-new-trail-around-kents-hoo-peninsula>`_
of the `England Coast Path
<https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/england-coast-path-south-east/>`_
had opened. The new section that goes from Woolwich in London, to the Isle of
Grain in Kent. At Woolwich it connects with the `Capital Ring
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Ring>`_ and now also the `Thames Path
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Path>`_, which got extended from the
`Thames Barrier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier>`_ to the start
of the new section of the England Coast Path. As it is a totally new part, it
wasn't mapped on OpenStreetMap either yet, something that just **had** to be
added by someone! I decided that someone would be me. Here be dragons.

This meant that on *January 15th, 2022* I headed out to Woolwich Arsenal on
the Tube and DLR to do some proper surveying. I found a GPX file to use in
case the England Coast Path wasn't clearly mapped, so that I would not get
lost.

When I got to the Thames to start, I was greeted with fog. Lots of fog.

Who would have thought that a cold day in January would bring fog to the
Thames? This however, did not deter me from attempting the first section. From
here to Greenhithe.

After leaving urban Woolwich Arsenal behind, the route takes past the
Plumstead Marshes, around Cross Ness. I then came upon the Victorian `Crossness Pumping
Station <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossness_Pumping_Station>`_, which was
used in the 19th and 20th centuries to pump sewer from London into a reservoir
which was then released into the Thames â€” downstream from the city. It has now
been converted into a `museum <https://www.crossness.org.uk/>`_.

The building also marks the start of a stretch along the Thames full of
loading docks, piers, and cranes. Some still in use. At one point, there is a
viewing platform that allows you look South across the Crossness Nature
Reserve (where they stored the poo during earlier times).

Between there and Erith, it is more piers, silos, and cranes. Erith is not a
particularly interesting town, but it is where nearly a decade ago I started
my first long distance walking adventure, the `LOOP <https://derickrethans.nl/the-loop-part1.html>`_.

The path East of Erith along the Thames is blocked by a large industrial
estate, and you have to divert along a road which lots of heavy traffic, even
on a Saturday. It is not a particularly nice section, and for many people this
would be the first encounter with the LOOP. I hope it does not put too many
people off walking the rest of it, as it gets **much** better. The England
Coast Path follows the LOOP for a significant distance, so I soldiered on.

Once you get back to the Thames, there is some pleasant walking, and I believe
the path has been restored as I remember it being a mud bath. There were a few
other walkers about, and I had a little chat with a couple that was carrying
the London LOOP guide book, and assured them it would only get better.

Rounding Crayford Ness and the Darent Industrial Park brought the Darent Flood
barrier into view.

The Thames continues on the other side of the Darent, but there is no bridge
which means you have to go around the river, through a small industrial area,
along the river Cray, back up, and along a busy dual carriage way, past a
quarry, and then back along the river Darent to the Thames. It takes an hour
and a half, even at my quick walking pace. It was not always easy walking on
the paths either, as many of them were chewed up by dirt bike tires, making it
all a muddy mess. Now that I had crossed the river, I had also arrived in
Kent.

Just east of the river Darent, the Dartfort Clay Shooting Club has their
shooting range. I was warned that I should be weary of falling shot due to
their activities, but I thought that was more of a joke then the truth. 
It wasn't, as I actually got hit by falling show on my head. Ow! Luckily neither
me, or any of my camera equipment got damaged. I don't understand how they can
get away with this, especially as I was so close to the Thames.

Continuing along the river the `Queen Elizabeth II Bridge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartford_Crossing>`_ grows larger
and larger, and by the time you pass Amazon's fulfilment centre, it is close
enough to make out the individual cables of the cable-stayed bridge that forms
part of the Dartford Crossing. The bridge is only used for Southbound traffic.

After another few kilometres zig-zagging through an industrial landscape I
came upon Greenhithe, where after nearly 5 and a half hours I finished the
first 32km of this new section of the England Coast Path.

I took the train home after I found the station, which was fairly well hidden
behind a hill and in a valley. At home I enjoyed some tasty `beers
<https://untappd.com/user/derickr/checkin/1120639402>`_ to relax.

Stay tuned for parts two and three!
