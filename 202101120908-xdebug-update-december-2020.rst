Another monthly update where I explain what happened with Xdebug development
in this past month. These will be published on the first Tuesday after the 5th
of each month.

`Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/derickr>`_ and `GitHub
<https://github.com/sponsors/derickr/>`_ supporters will get it earlier, on
the first of each month.

You can `become a patron <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7864328>`_ or
support me through `GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/derickr>`_.
I am currently 82% towards my $1,000 per month goal. If you're already
supporting Xdebug's development, could you do me a favour and tweet this out?

If you are leading a team or company, then it is also possible to support
Xdebug through `a subscription <https://xdebug.org/support>`_.

In December, I worked on Xdebug for about 46 hours, with funding being around
30 hours. I worked mostly on the following things:

Releases
--------

A few bugs were found in Xdebug 3.0.0, which should not come as a surprise, as
with any big .0 release, users always find things that go wrong. December
saw the 3.0.1 release, and the 3.0.2 released followed in the new year.

`Xdebug 3.0.1 <https://xdebug.org/announcements/2020-12-04>`_ fixed several
crashes and other bugs that are present in Xdebug 3.0.0. The crash when
removing a breakpoint (or run-to-cursor) was the most notable fix in this
release.

You'll have to wait for the January 2021 wrap up to find out about the
3.0.2 release, or you can have a look at the `release announcement
<https://xdebug.org/announcements/2021-01-04>`_.

There are also new release of PhpStorm and the VS Code Plugin to address a few
Xdebug related issues from their sides. On top of that, the GitHub repository of
the `VS Code Plugin <https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug>`_ has been
moved to the `Xdebug organisation <https://github.com/xdebug>`_. There is a
back log of pull requests and issues that need looking at.

Videos
------

I have started making `videos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4>`_
to introduce Xdebug 3 and how to use it. The first one on Xdebug 3's modes can
be watched on `YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF61HJHEYMk&list=PLg9Kjjye-m1g_eXpdaifUqLqALLqZqKd4&index=1>`_.

I am currently working on a video to explain all the new features in Xdebug
that help you find problems with running Xdebug itself.

Xdebug Cloud
------------

I have been continuing to test `Xdebug Cloud <https://cloud.xdebug.com>`_, and
I am working with a few private alpha testers. They're putting the hosted
Cloud service through its paces.

At the same time I am working with a designer to make the
https://cloud.xdebug.com look pretty too.

If you want to be kept up to date with Xdebug Cloud, please sign up to the
`mailinglist <http://cloud.xdebug.com>`_, which I will use to send out an
update not more than once a month.
